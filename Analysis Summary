According to the analysis, the overall passing percentage is the highest from medium (1000-2000 students) sized schools, with the charter schools having the best overall passing rate between charter and district schools with 90%. The highest overall passing schools are Cabrera High School,
Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School, all of which are charter schools. The bottom performing schools by overall passing percentage are Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, and Johnson
High School, all of which are district schools. 

A conclusion from the data would be that while Bailey High School has the highest school budget, it ranks as one of the lower overall passing percentages. Another conclusion that can be reached from the data is that the students with the lowest spending range (<$585) have the
highest overall passing rate.
